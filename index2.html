      <h3>
        Coming to Sarajevo is always a good
      </h3>
      <h3>
        choice!
      </h3>
      <p>
        Very few cities in the world can offer such a variety of
        interesting things in such a small area as Sarajevo does.
        Historical attractions, natural beauty and unique
        experience of a place where "East meets West" are all
        reasons which attract and continue to bring so many
        visitors to Sarajevo. Winter offers plenty of opportunities
        for winter sports and recreation in the snow. Spring and
        autumn, with their mild climate offer opportunities for
        pleasant exploration of natural beauty of the outskirts and
        a vibrant programme of cultural events in the city. Summer
        is a time when the city, its squares and streets become an
        on-the-go holiday; it is the time when the city lives
        twenty-four seven.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sarajevo has its own specific gravity, so a single visit
        very often becomes the start of a more permanent attachment
        to this city and its people. So the best thing to do is to
        visit because we’d like to hear if you fell in love with
        Sarajevo too!

        The city of Sarajevo is spread over 142 square kilometers
        and established as a local self-governing unit within
        Kanton Sarajevo. The city consists of four municipalities:
        Old Town, Center; New City and New Sarajevo.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sarajevo is a city located in the valley and surrounded by
        mountain ranges from all sides. Miljacka River divides it
        into two unequal parts and the city expands from its
        shores. Therefore, the journey through Sarajevo is best
        taken down the river for which many people say there is no
        smaller river with a larger number of bridges to cross it.

        Baščaršija
      </h4>
      <p>
        Ottoman era begins in 1461 when the city was founded by the
        first Bosnian governor Ishak-beg Isaković (Ishak Bay
        Isaković), a pioneer in planned construction. He had the
        Careva džamija (Emperor’s Mosque) built first; followed by
        Tekija (Khanqah), lodgings, administrative center and
        housing court he named Saraj, which is how Sarajevo got its
        name. In Baščaršija, he builds Kolobara Han (Kolobara Inn),
        a hotel in modern terms, which was soon surrounded by a
        multitude of shops creating the economic basis for the
        development of the city.
