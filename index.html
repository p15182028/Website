  <h3>Coming to Sarajevo is always a good choice! </h3>
  <p>Very few cities in the world can offer such a variety of interesting things in such a small area as Sarajevo does. Historical attractions,
    natural beauty and unique experience of a place where "East meets West" are all reasons which  attract and continue to bring so many
     visitors to Sarajevo. Winter offers plenty of opportunities for winter sports and recreation in the snow. Spring and autumn, with
     their mild climate offer opportunities for pleasant exploration of natural beauty of the outskirts and a vibrant programme of cultural events in the city.
      Summer is a time when the city, its squares and streets become an on-the-go holiday; it is the time when the city lives twenty-four seven.
      </p>
    <p>Sarajevo has its own specific gravity, so a single visit very often becomes the start of a more permanent attachment to this city and its people. So the best
 thing to do is to visit because we’d like to hear if you fell in love with Sarajevo too!

    Sarajevo is a city located in the valley and surrounded by mountain ranges from all sides. Miljacka River divides it into two
    unequal parts and the city expands from its shores. Therefore, the journey through Sarajevo is best taken down the river for
    which many people say there is no smaller river with a larger number of bridges to cross it.

    Ottoman era begins in 1461 when the city was founded by the first Bosnian governor Ishak-beg Isaković
     (Ishak Bay Isaković), a pioneer in planned construction. He had the Careva džamija (Emperor’s Mosque) built first; followed by
      Tekija (Khanqah), lodgings, administrative center and housing court he named Saraj, which is how Sarajevo got its name. In Baščaršija,
       he builds Kolobara Han (Kolobara Inn), a hotel in modern terms, which was soon surrounded by a multitude of shops creating the economic
        basis for the development of the city.
