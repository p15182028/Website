  <h3>Coming to Sarajevo is always a good choice! </h3>
  <p>Very few cities in the world can offer such a variety of interesting things in such a small area as Sarajevo does. Historical attractions,
    natural beauty and unique experience of a place where "East meets West" are all reasons which  attract and continue to bring so many
     visitors to Sarajevo. Winter offers plenty of opportunities for winter sports and recreation in the snow. Spring and autumn, with
     their mild climate offer opportunities for pleasant exploration of natural beauty of the outskirts and a vibrant programme of cultural events in the city.
      Summer is a time when the city, its squares and streets become an on-the-go holiday; it is the time when the city lives twenty-four seven.

Sarajevo has its own specific gravity, so a single visit very often becomes the start of a more permanent attachment to this city and its people. So the best
 thing to do is to visit because weâ€™d like to hear if you fell in love with Sarajevo too!
